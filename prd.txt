### 1. 🧠 Problem Statement

Cooking is hard. Chopping onions makes us cry, boiling pasta feels like rocket science after work, and don’t even get us started on doing the dishes. People want hot meals, not hot messes. Let's fix that with robots.

---

### 2. 🎯 Goal

Design and launch a kitchen robot that can cook delicious meals on command without setting the kitchen (or itself) on fire.

### 3. 🧰 Features & Requirements

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Multi-Arm Cooking System | Able to chop, stir, flip, and high-five. |
| Recipe Intelligence | Can follow and adapt recipes based on ingredients, dietary preferences, and mood swings. |
| Ingredient Detection | Scans pantry/fridge and knows when you're out of garlic (again). |
| Voice Command Integration | Works with "Hey RoboChef, make me tacos." |
| Safety Protocols | Doesn’t mistake your cat for a chicken nugget. |
