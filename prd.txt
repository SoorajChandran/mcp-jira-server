### 🛸 Overview
We’re launching a rocket with humans to **Planet Blipblop**, a mysterious but oddly chill planet located in the **Snaccaroon Galaxy**, roughly 92 quazillion lightyears from Earth. The mission? Establish the first **intergalactic outpost-slash-coffee-shop** and prove that humans can survive a long-haul flight without complaining about the Wi-Fi.

### 🌟 Goals & Success Criteria

| Goal | Success Criteria |
|------|------------------|
| Launch a rocket to Blipblop | Rocket leaves Earth without turning into fireworks |
| Land safely on Blipblop | All humans onboard remain upright and breathing |
| Establish communications | Earth receives at least one “we made it” selfie |
| Set up first Intergalactic Cafe | Aliens leave 4+ star reviews on Yelp Nebula |

---

### 🚀 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Design and launch of the **Rocketship “YOLO-1”**
- Onboard snacks, Spotify playlist, and Zero-G yoga routines
- Portable habitat pod with beanbags and espresso machine
- Blipblop Cultural Exchange Program (bring memes, return alien GIFs)

**Out of Scope:**
- Return trip planning (TBD, might just Uber back)
- Terraforming (Blipblop is already more livable than most coworking spaces)
- Dealing with Blipblopian bureaucracy

### 👩‍🚀 Users

1. **Astronauts**: Human guinea pigs with space suits and Spotify Premium.
2. **Blipblopians**: Native species, mostly friendly, mildly sarcastic.
3. **Mission Control**: Earth-based team fueled by cold brew and anxiety.

- **Navigation & Autopilot:**  
  - BlipNav™ system with 3D holographic map, sarcasm-mode enabled.

  - Inflatable landing cushion in case someone forgets to put the gear down (again).
- **Communication System:**

#### 🧟‍♀️ Human Passenger Systems

- **Life Support Module:**  
  - Oxygen generation via singing plants and backup tanks.  
  - Water recycled from astronaut tears (just kidding… or are we?).

  - Zero-gravity hammocks with built-in lullaby generator.  
  - Curtains for privacy and dramatic reveal scenes.

#### 🧑‍🍳 Onboard Amenities

  - Built-in snack dispenser that requires solving a riddle first (for cognitive stimulation).
- **Hydration Station:**  
  - 3 options: water, coffee, and suspiciously green "Blipblop Juice™."
- **Entertainment Module:**  
  - Movie nights projected on ceiling (yes, it’s always upside-down).  
  - Holographic karaoke with auto-tune mandatory.  
  - Multiplayer Uno: losing results in temporary chore duty.
